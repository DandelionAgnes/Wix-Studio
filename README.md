Wix Studio Interactive Gray to Color Icon change. 
1. Uploaded two version of the icons: color and gray. Stack them on top of each other.
2. Make sure to label all component (e.g., #icon1gray, #icon1color).
3. Apply the code, make sure the components' names in the code match the names asigned to the component.

Dark and Light Mode Toggle: I created this code to switch between dark and light mode on my portfolio website.
1. Set up: For each section of your page, create two versions: dark and light mode.
2. Make sure you ID each version clearly Add the switch to the header.
3. For the Header, I stacked two menu versions on tope of each other and create a background box to change the header's background color.
4. The rest can be recolored in the code.
Issues: The toggle is not activated fully until the first click. So the first click doesn't switch to dark mode right away. But from the second click, everything works fine.
